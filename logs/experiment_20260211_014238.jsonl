He formally announced his campaign on November 15, 2022, initially battling for the Republican Party's nomination. While many candidates challenged the former president for the nomination, they did not manage to amass enough support, leading Trump to a landslide victory in the 2024 Iowa caucuses. On March 12, 2024, he became the Republican Party \"Republican Party (United States)\")'s presumptive nominee. Trump was officially nominated on July 15 at the Republican National Convention, where he chose JD Vance, the junior U.S. senator from Ohio, as his vice presidential running mate.

Of particular note were plans to allow the president to directly set interest rates, remove Chair Jerome Powell before his term expires in 2026, and subject the Fed to oversight from the OMB. Trump stated in a press conference in August 2024 at Mar-a-Lago that he \"[feels] the president should have at least [a] say in there\" with respect to Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize in Economics laureates signed an open letter arguing that Trump's fiscal and trade policies coupled with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve's independence would reignite an inflation surge in the United States. [...] As president, Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Democratic \"Democratic Party (United States)\") nominee Joe Biden. He and his allies in seven key states denied the results. They allegedly went on to devise a plot to create and submit fraudulent certificates of ascertainment falsely asserting that Trump had won the electoral college vote in those states. In the event that the plot failed to \"work out,\" Trump would plan another presidential run in 2024. On January 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol to prevent the true election results from being certified.
