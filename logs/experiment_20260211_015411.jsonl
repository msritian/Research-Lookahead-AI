Predicting the US Presidential Election", "content": "### 4.2 Prediction Results\n\nThe 2024 forecast by the LLM reveals several notable shifts compared to the 2020 prediction. A key change is in Wisconsin (WI), where Trump is now projected to win with 54.90% of the vote, marking a significant shift from 2020. Additionally, Trump shows improved performance in other swing and tipping-point states, including Pennsylvania (PA) with 47.85%, Michigan (MI) with 48.87%, and New Hampshire (NH) with 46.39%. However, despite these gains, he is still forecasted to narrowly lose these states to Harris. [...] Prediction Results. Based on the LLM\u2019s predictions and the winner-takes-all electoral vote allocation, Trump is projected to win 268 electoral votes compared to Harris\u2019s 259, securing a narrow victory. However, if we were to include the excluded states\u2014Connecticut (CT) and Rhode Island (RI)\u2014using their 2020 results, Harris\u2019s total would rise to 270 electoral votes, resulting in a razor-thin margin in favor of the Democratic candidate. [...] The overall results indicate competitive dynamics in key swing states, where narrow margins may determine the final outcome. As shown in Figure 6, Trump is projected to win several battleground states like Georgia (GA) and Florida (FL) with 44.36% and 53.62%, respectively, strengthening his position.
